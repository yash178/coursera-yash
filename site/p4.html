	Photographic work can be divided into dozens of categories, many with lots of sub-categories. The following list describes some common types of photography.


<ol>
<li>Aerial: From a plane, helicopter, balloon or other airborne device.</li>
<li>Adventure, Action: Adventure sports, daring feats, etc.</li>
<li>Animal, Pet: Pets and their relationships with humans. Note that the human content is often as important as the animal.</li>
<li>Architecture, Real Estate: The art of making property appear attractive. Often involves panoramic photography.</li>
<li>Artistic: Photography in which creative composition is the goal.</li>
<li>Black &amp; White: Not simply photography without colour, black and white photography explores shapes, tones and textures. Shadows and highlights become much more important.</li>
